    "In this tutorial we will look at how you can use Python, a generalist's programming language with a strong data science pedigree, to answer Information Requests, FoIs, and other data queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in, it's worth spending a moment on the question, why use Python for this set of tasks in the first place. Without having a compelling answer to this question, the \"how\" part becomes mostly irrelevant. We already have `SPSS`, `SQL`, `Excel VBA` and `R` to contend with so why another tool / language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main advantages of Python that come to my mind after having worked with it in data-related contexts for close to 4 years:\n",
    "***\n",
    " - #### Python is good _to_ beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to get off the ground with a new language. In the beginning, there are many potential stumbling blocks: from the initial setup and unfamiliar error messages to the idiosyncratic syntax that appears to have more in common with machine code than a human-readable interface. Python is not completely immune to these, but its designers have made a concerted effort to make things simple. To quote [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), Simple is better than Complex; Complex is better than Complicated.\n",
    "***\n",
    " - #### Python is fast _enough_.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Fast enough to quickly iterate on a new idea, fast enough to crunch through GBs of data in seconds, fast enough for _most_ production-ready projects. And when your Python code is already as performant as it can possibly be, and you still need more speed, Python makes it easy to compile into [faster, closer-to-the-metal languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58W9A2lnQc) or [run chunks of code in parallel](https://dask.org/). \n",
    "***\n",
    " - #### Python has a mature data science ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "No programming language is an island. There are libraries, extensions, IDEs that grow around a language as the needs of its users evolve. Python is no exception. One of the strenghts of Python's data science (DS) stack is that the community over the years has aligned on a few key libraries to provide the baseline functionality that meets 95% of user DS needs. From the quality point of view, this concentrates developer effort and expertise and from the user point of view, it means you only need to learn the conventions and APIs of one or two libraries. Contrast that with `Javascript` and its framework wars. \n",
    "*** \n",
    " - #### Python is open source and has a great community \n",
    "    \n",
    "Python is not a niche language: it's used extensively by commercial giants, like Netflix and [AstraZeneca](https://stxnext.com/blog/2020/03/17/most-interesting-companies-using-python/), machine learning start-ups, web developers, IoT hobbyists and many others. It's been consistenly voted to be among top [most loved programming languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages) by StackOverflow developers and is the fastest growing language. Thanks to this community, getting help when starting out with Python is easy, and when you want to expand your knowledge beyond basic scripting, there is a wealth of advanced tutorials online and in printed form.  \n",
